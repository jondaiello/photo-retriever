# Photo Retriever

This is a simple photo display app. The goal is to pull a random set of photos and display them in a grid. The user can click to expand a photo, then navigate to the previous and next photo.

I am using the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to return a randomly generated set of photos. I chose Unsplash because they are my go-to source for great images that I often use for my desktop backgrounds.

The demo is intended to demonstrate my ability to:

- Access a public API and successfully retrieve data from it;
- Display that data on a page;
- Update the UI of a page without refreshing;
- Build a polished user experience you'd be proud to ship; and
- Do all of the above using only native JavaScript (no libraries such as jQuery, although CSS preprocessors are fine).

In the end, it will be posted in an area where it will be publicly accessible.

It will run without errors in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE.
